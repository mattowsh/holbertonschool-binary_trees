## What is a binary tree?
A binary Tree is a **tree data structure** with at most 2 children. Since each element can have only 2 children: typically named the left and right child.

A binary tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node of the tree called **root**. If the tree is empty, then the value of the root is NULL.

Binary Tree node contains the following parts:
- **Data**
- **Pointer to the left child**
- **Pointer to the right child**

In this project, we used too a **pointer to the parent node**.

## Types of binary trees
- **FULL**: binary tree that each node must contain either 0 or 2 children

- **COMPLETE**: binary tree in which all the nodes are completely filled except the last level (leaf nodes). Also, in the last level, all the nodes must be as left as possible

- **PERFECT**: binary tree that all the nodes have 2 children, and all the leaf nodes are at the same level

- **DEGENERATE**: binary tree in which all the internal nodes have only one children. Can be right-skewed or left-skewed in function to the children nodes existence

- **BALANCED**: binary tree in which the height of the left subtree and right subtree of any node does not differ by more than 1 and both the left and right subtree are also height balanced
