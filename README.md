## What is a binary tree?
A binary Tree is a **tree data structure** with at most 2 children. Since each element can have only 2 children: typically named the left and right child.

A binary tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node of the tree called **root**. If the tree is empty, then the value of the root is NULL.

Binary Tree node contains the following parts:
- **Data**
- **Pointer to the left child**
- **Pointer to the right child**

In this project, we used too a **pointer to the parent node**.
